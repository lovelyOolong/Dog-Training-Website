						<h3>How to Train Your Dog to Listen</h3>

						<p>Difficulty: Easy<br />
						<br />What you need: A big handful of your dog’s favorite treats, squeaky toy, stinky treats, and a leash<br />

				<p>1. Start indoors at the end of your dog’s six-foot leash.<br />
				<br />2. Hold up a toy or treat, then say his name followed by “come” in a clear, excited tone.<br />
				<br />3. If necessary, make movements such as tapping your knees and stepping backward.<br />
				<br />4. As soon as your dog comes to you, give him the reward, then praise him lavishly (but try not to cause overexcitement).<br />
				<br />5. Repeat 5 to 6 times, gradually moving to different areas of your home, including outdoors.<br />
				<br />6. As your dog improves, move to areas with more distractions.<br />
				<br />7. Gradually increase the distance between you and your dog. You may wish to use a long lead (10 feet or more).<br />
				<br />8. Once your dog has mastered the recall while on the long leash, practice it without any leash, but only indoors or in a fenced-in area.<br />
				<br />9. Slowly phase out the toy or treat rewards, but keep rewarding with much praise.</p>

				<p>1. If he barks at people or animals passing by the living room window, manage his behavior by closing the curtains or putting your dog in another room.<br />
				<br />2. If he barks at passersby when he's in the yard, bring him into the house. Never leave your dog outside unsupervised all day and night.<br />
				<br />3. When you put your dog in his crate or in a gated room, turn your back and ignore him.<br />
				<br />4. Once he stops barking, turn around, praise him, and give him a treat.<br />
				<br />5. As he catches on that being quiet gets him a treat, lengthen the amount of time he must remain quiet before being rewarded.<br />
				<br />6. Remember to start small by rewarding him for being quiet for just a few seconds, then working up to longer periods of quiet.<br />
				<br />7. Keep it fun by varying the amount of time. Sometimes reward him after 5 seconds, then 12 seconds, then 3 seconds, then 20 seconds, and so on.<br />
				<br />8. Once you've taught your dog the "quiet" command in a calm environment, practice in increasingly distracting situations until your dog can immediately stop barking when asked to, even when that "intruder" arrives at the door.</p>

						<h3>How to Train Your Dog to Stop Pulling the Leash</h3>

					<div class="subtitle_text">
						<p>Difficulty: Medium<br />

				<p>1. Attach the leash to the live ring of the training collar.<br />
				<br />2. Put the loop of the leash over the thumb of your right hand and make a fist. As a safety precaution, don’t put your entire hand through the loop of the leash or wrap it around your hand. If your dog catches you unaware and makes a dash, he could cause you to fall. By having the loop over your thumb, you can just let go, and it’ll slide off.<br />
				<br />3. Place your left hand directly under your right, holding the leash in both hands as though it were a baseball bat.<br />
				<br />4. Say, “Let’s go,” and start walking.<br />
				<br />5. Just before he gets to the end of the leash, say your dog’s name and “easy,” make an about-turn to your right, and walk in the opposite direction.<br />
				<br />6. You need to repeat this sequence several times over the course of a few training sessions until your dog understands that you don’t want him to pull.</p>

						<h3>How to Stop a Dog From Being Aggressive</h3>

						<p>Difficulty: Hard<br />

				<p>1. Avoid overly-aroused play situations.If your dog plays too roughly in these situations, remove him: choose quieter, less stressful venues for him.<br />
				<br />2. Reinforce calm behavior. If you and your dog are approaching a dog park or playgroup and your dog begins barking excitedly, turn around and walk him away. Leave the building or return to your car and wait until your dog is calm again.<br />
				<br />3. Continue introducing your adolescent to well-behaved adult dogs. If the adult dog pursues the adolescent, this is inappropriate and must be interrupted.<br />
				<br />4. Allow your dog to rehearse only desirable behavior. Remember that any behavior will strengthen with practice so don’t let them rehearse the wrong behavior.<br />
				<br />5. Teach your dog to calm himself down. Put your dog on leash while you watch TV and ignore him. If he climbs in your lap, gently move him away from you with the leash. If he barks, ignore him. Wait until he settles quietly on the floor, then quietly praise him. If he jumps up again, start over.<br />
				<br />6. Practicing the “settle” exercise regularly will teach your dog that calm behavior is the way to get your attention.</p>

				<h2 class="responsive-text">Why People Abandon Dogs</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p class="responsive-text">Behavioral problems are the most common reason why people give up their dogs. Behavioral problems can be very serious, like biting or aggression in dogs. But more often they are common dog issues like inappropriate elimination, destructiveness, barking, or not getting along with other animals in the home. Most behavioral issues can be corrected, but people may lack the knowledge or commitment needed to do the work.</p>

					<p class="responsive-text">Most of the time, when you see an aggressive dog it wasn’t born that way. Owners of dogs just may not fully understand how to train their dog. This lack of training often leads to aggressive behavior in dogs because they are responding to situations using their instincts, and not proper training since they have never been taught differently.<br />
